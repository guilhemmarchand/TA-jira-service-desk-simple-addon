Using the JIRA Service Desk alert action from alerts and correlation searches
=============================================================================

**Whenever you create or configure a Splunk core alert or Enterprise Security correlation search, you can now select the JIRA Service Desk action to automatically create a new JIRA issue based on the results of a search.**

The configuration of the alert is pretty straightforward and described in detail in the further sections of the above documentation.

Using the JIRA Service Desk alert adaptive response action from Splunk Enterprise Security
==========================================================================================

**In Splunk Enterprise Security, the JIRA action can be triggered as an adaptive response action from Incident Review:**

   :align: center

The same options are available with the same level of features; however, tokens expansion will depend on the notable event context.

JIRA project
============

.. image:: img/userguide2.png
   :alt: userguide2.png
   :align: center

Several projects might have been created in your JIRA instance; you can choose any of the projects available on per alert basis.

The list of JIRA projects made available within the configuration screen is the result of a dynamic REST call achieved against your JIRA instance anytime you access this screen, which can be reproduced manually too:

::

    | jirafill opt=1 | stats count by key, key_projects

JIRA issue type
===============

.. image:: img/userguide3.png
   :alt: userguide3.png
   :align: center

The type of issue to be created is a dynamic list provided by JIRA based on the types available for the project that has been selected, these are the result of the following command:

::

    | jirafill opt=2 | stats count by issues

JIRA issue priority
===================

.. image:: img/userguide4.png
   :alt: userguide4.png
   :align: center

The priority of the issue is dynamically retrieved from the JIRA project based on the different priorities that are made available by your JIRA screen configuration, these are the results of the following command:

::

    | jirafill opt=3 | stats count by priorities

JIRA issue dynamic priority
===========================

.. image:: img/userguide5.png
   :alt: userguide5.png
   :align: center

**The dynamic priority is a feature that allows you to dynamically define the priority based on the search result rather than a selected priority from the dynamic list provided by JIRA.**

To use the priority of the search results, you need to define a field in your search results that exactly match the priority value expected by JIRA, which can obviously be the results of conditional operations in your SPL logic.

*Assuming the following simplistic example in your search:*

::

    | eval jira_priority=case(count<10, "low", count>=10 AND count<50, "medium", count>=50, "high")

*You will define the dynamic priority to:* ``$result.jira_priority$``

The dynamic priority is entirely **optional** and is only used if it has been defined in the alert configuration.

JIRA summary and description
============================

.. image:: img/userguide6.png
   :alt: userguide6.png
   :align: center

JIRA summary and description are the core information of a JIRA issue.

These two fields define the title of the JIRA issue, and its main content visible to your JIRA users.

Both fields will automatically handle any dynamic value that are available from the results of your search, which requires to be defined as ``$result.myfield$`` to be automatically translated into the relevant value.

JIRA assignee
=============

.. image:: img/userguide7.png
   :alt: userguide7.png
   :align: center

The JIRA assignee field is **optional**, and can be defined to a static or a dynamic value (using a token) to automatically assign the issue to a specific JIRA user.

JIRA reporter
=============

.. image:: img/jira_reporter.png
   :alt: jira_reporter.png
   :align: center

The JIRA reporter field is **optional**, and can be defined to a static or a dynamic value (using a token) to automatically assign the issue to a specific JIRA user.

JIRA labels
===========

.. image:: img/userguide8.png
   :alt: userguide8.png
   :align: center

JIRA labels is an **optional** field, which can be defined as a comma separated list of values to assign a list of labels to the JIRA issue.

JIRA components
===============

.. image:: img/components.png
   :alt: components.png
   :align: center

JIRA components is an **optional** field, which can be defined as a comma separated list of values to assign a list of components to the JIRA issue. (by their names)

JIRA dedup behavior
====================

.. image:: img/jira_dedup1.png
   :alt: jira_dedup1.png
   :align: center

**The JIRA deduplication option is a per alert option which is disabled by default.**

**Once the option is enabled for an alert, the following workflow applies:**

- When an alert triggers with the JIRA issue creation action, the Python backend verifies the md5 hash of the full issue content to be created
- This md5 hash is compared with records stored in the backlog collection
- Shall the md5 hash be matching, the JIRA issue key reference is extracted from backlog KVstore
- As the JIRA dedup option is enabled, the Python backend will add a new comment to this JIRA issue, instead of creating a brand new issue with the entire same content
- The content of the comment can be modified (defaults to: New alert triggered: <issue summary>) by defining a field named "jira_update_comment" as part of the search results
- If the field jira_update_comment exists, its content will automatically be added as the comment

**The Overview dashboard exposes tickets that have been updated due to deduplication as "success_update" rather than "success" for a standard creation:**

.. image:: img/jira_dedup2.png
   :alt: jira_dedup2.png
   :align: center

**When a ticket is detected as a duplication creation request due to md5 matching, the backend logs events that describe its activity:**

::

    JIRA Service Desk ticket successfully updated

The JIRA returned information are logged as well and contain the ticket reference key, id, and more.

**Open the report "JIRA Service Desk - Issues backlog collection" to access the backlog collection:**

- **key** is the internal uuid of the KVstore, as well the key will be equal to the md5 hash of the first occurrence of JIRA issue created (next occurrences will have a key uuid generated automatically with no link with the md5 of the issue)
- **ctime** is the milliseconds epochtime that corresponds to the initial creation of the ticket, this value can not be changed once the record is created
- **mtime** is the milliseconds epochtime of the last modification of the record, if a comment is added to this ticket, this value corresponds to the time of that action
- **jira_md5** is the actual md5 hash for the entire JIRA issue, when the dedup option is activated for an alert, this will always be equal to the key id of the record in the KVstore
- **status** reflects the status of the issue as it is known from the add-on perspective, created means the issue was created, updated means at least one comment was made to this ticket due to dedup matching
- **jira_id / jira_key / jira_self** are JIRA information related to this ticket

.. image:: img/jira_dedup3.png
   :alt: jira_dedup3.png
   :align: center

**Additional options for the dedup feature:**

- **JIRA dedup excluded status categories** lists all the JIRA status categories to be excluded, if the status category of the duplicated issue is in this list, a new ticket will be created instead of a comment added to resolved or closed ticket
- **JIRA dedup content** by default the entire JIRA issue is used for the md5 calculation, which is used to identity a duplicate, this option allows granular control over the behavior

JIRA attachment
===============

.. image:: img/attachment1.png
   :alt: attachment1.png
   :align: center

**On a per alter basis, the results from the Splunk alert that triggered can automatically be attached to the JIRA issue.**

**Features and limitations:**

- The attachment feature is disabled by default, and needs to be enabled on a per alert basis
- The format of the results can be attached in CSV format, or JSON format
- JIRA file preview only supports the CSV format at the time of this writing
- The feature is not currently available if an HTTP proxy is used (a warning message will be emitted in logs, but the action will have not effects)
- The feature is not compatible with the resilient store, if the JIRA issue initially fails due to a temporary failure, the ticket will be created by the resilient tracker when possible but without the original attachment

*When the attachment option is enabled, the following message will be logged if the attachment was successfully added to the JIRA issue, in addition with details of the ticket returned by JIRA:*

``JIRA Service Desk ticket attachment file uploaded successfully``

**File attachment in JIRA:**

*Note: the file name is dynamically generated, prefixed with "splunk_alert_results_" and suffixed by the relevant file extension.*

JIRA custom fields
==================

.. image:: img/userguide9.png
   :alt: userguide9.png
   :align: center

**JIRA custom fields are fields that can designed by your JIRA administrators to be available during the issue creation.**

The Splunk Add-on for JIRA Service Desk supports any kind and any number of custom fields by allowing you to insert a custom field JSON structure in the alert configuration.

**There are different types of custom fields, from a single ling text input to date and time pickers, which are described in the JIRA API documentation:**

https://developer.atlassian.com/server/jira/platform/jira-rest-api-examples

.. image:: img/userguide10.png
   :alt: userguide10.png
   :align: center

**Depending on the format of the custom field, you need to use the proper syntax, the most common are:**

::

    "customfield_10048": "$result.singleline_text$",

::

    "customfield_10052": {"value": "$result.single_choice$"},

::

    "customfield_10053": [ {"value": "$result.multi_choice_grp1$" }, {"value": "$result.multi_choice_grp2" }]

**As usual, while you define the custom fields, you can use dynamic results from the Splunk search results by using the syntax:** ``$result.myfield$``

To add a list of custom fields, make sure you add a comma after each custom field, and none at the end of the JSON structure.

*A full example JSON structure is provided in the alert action screen:*

::

    "customfield_10048": "$result.singleline_text$",
    "customfield_10052": {"value": "$result.single_choice$"},
    "customfield_10053": [ {"value": "$result.multi_choice_grp1$" }, {"value": "$result.multi_choice_grp2" }]

**Custom fields parsing:**

By default, the content of the custom fields is parsed to escape and protect any special characters that would potentially lead the JSON data not to be parsed properly.

In some circumstances, the built-in parser rules may fail to recognize an unexpected custom fields structure, the parsing can be disabled if required:

How to retrieve the IDs of the custom fields configured ?
---------------------------------------------------------

**Use the built-in report and associate custom command to retrieve the list of JIRA fields information:**

.. image:: img/userguide_getfields1.png
   :alt: userguide_getfields1.png
   :align: center

**This report achieves a REST call to JIRA to get the list of fields and their details per project and per type of issues, search for custom fields:**

.. image:: img/userguide_getfields2.png
   :alt: userguide_getfields2.png
   :align: center

JIRA REST API wrapper
=========================

**A custom command is provided as a generic API wrapper which can be used to get information from JIRA by calling any REST endpoint available:**  
By default, it uses method GET. Additional methods are supported DELETE, POST, PUT.

::

   | jirarest target="<endpoint>"

**Open the REST API dashboard to get examples of usage:**

.. image:: img/jirarest_001.png
   :alt: jirarest_001.png
   :align: center

**The following report is provided to retrieve issues statistics per project and per status categories:**

::

   JIRA Service Desk - Issues statistics report per project

Indexing JIRA statistics for reporting purposes
-----------------------------------------------

**If you wish to index the JIRA statistic results in Splunk for reporting purposes over time, you can easily modify or clone this report to use collect or mcollect to index these statistics:**

Indexing the results to a summary report
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can use the ``collect`` command to automatically index the report results in a summary index of your choice, schedule this report and add a call to collect, example:

::

   | collect index=summary source="JIRA - issues stats per project"

.. image:: img/jirarest_003.png
   :alt: jirarest_003.png
   :align: center

Indexing the results to a metric index
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Another option is to use the mcollect command to automatically index these statistics as native metrics in a metric index of your choice, the following example assumes a metric index named "jira_metrics" was created, the report scheduled and the following mcollect command is added:

::

   | eval type="jira_" | mcollect split=t prefix_field=type index=jira_metrics project

Each statistic is stored as a metric_name with a prefix "jira\_", while the project is stored as a dimension, you can use the mcatalog and mstats commands to use the metrics, or use the Analytics view in Splunk:

*mcatalog example:*

::

   | mcatalog values(metric_name) values(_dims) where index=jira_metrics metric_name=jira_*

*mstats example:*

::

   | mstats latest(jira_pct_total_done) as pct_total_done, latest(jira_pct_total_in_progress) as pct_total_in_progress, latest(jira_pct_total_to_do) as pct_total_to_do where index=jira_metrics by project span=5m

Additional examples for JIRA API wrapper
----------------------------------------

Method DELETE: Delete an issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   | jirarest target="rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}" method=DELETE


Method POST: Add a comment to an issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Example 1:*

::

   | jirarest target="rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/comment" method=POST json_request="{\"body\": \"This is a normal comment.\"}"

*Example 2:*

::

   | jirarest target="rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/comment" method=POST json_request="{\"body\": \"This is a comment that only administrators can see.\", \"visibility\": {\"type\": \"role\", \"value\": \"Administrators\"}}"

Method PUT: Assign an issue
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   | jirarest target="rest/api/2/issue/{issueIdOrKey}/assignee" method=PUT json_request="{\"name\": \"harry\"}"
